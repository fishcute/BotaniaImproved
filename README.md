# Botania Improved

**Important Note**: This resource pack still contains original textures from Botania (Since resource pack is WIP). All credit for unoriginal textures goes to the [Violet Moon Team](https://github.com/VazkiiMods). Additionally, if you do not know what Botania is, please check it out [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/botania).

Botania Improved (Temporary name) is a project where I am attempting to improve/modernize Botania's textures and style. A lot of things are WIP, and subject to change. If you feel that something is off, feel free to make an issue/suggestion. As of right now, I am working on items/armor textures. Blocks will come next.

## Below is a list of WIP textures that will probably be changed:

- Armor
- Terrablade
- Mana items
- Black Hole Pendant (Adding +1 frame)

## Things I am planning on retexturing:

- Rest of items
- Blocks
- Entities/Block entities

## Things I am not planning on retexturing:

- Tiny potato
- Particles
