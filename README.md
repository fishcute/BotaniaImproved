# Botania Improved

This is a moderate sized project, where I am attempting to improve/modernize Botania's textures and style. A lot of things are WIP, and subject to change. If you feel that something is off, feel free to make an issue/suggestion. As of right now, I am working on items/armor textures. Blocks will come next.

## Below is a list of WIP textures that will probably be changed:

- Armor
- Terrablade
- Mana items

## Things I am planning on retexturing:

- Rest of items
- Blocks
- Entities/Block entities

## Things I am not planning on retexturing:

- Tiny potato
- Particles
